```

cd likee-scraper
shards build --release
```

3. Move the binary to your PATH or use it right away:

```

## Usage

For more examples, please refer to the [**documentation**](https://absolab.xyz/likee-scraper).

### Download profile by @username

Looking up a user by username requires an additional API request. It's strongly
recommended to use User IDs. Usernames must be prefixed with an `@`.

```bash
$ likeer -u @username1 -u @username2
```

### Download profile by ID

If a identifier does not have a prefix, it is assumed to be an User ID.

```bash
$ likeer -u 11111111
```

### Batch file

If `--batch-file <file.txt>` (or `-a`) is given, Likee will read *file.txt*
expecting @usernames and User IDs to download, one identifier per line.
Lines starting with "#" or empty lines are considered as comments and ignored.

Usernames must be prefixed with an `@`, e.g. `@username`.

IDs must not be prefixed with an `@`, e.g. `1111111`.

```bash
$ cat batch.txt
~> # Comment (ignored)
~> @username
~> 111111111
$ likeer -a batch.txt
```

### Fast update

If `--fast-update` (or `-f`) is given, Likeer stops when arriving at the
first already downloaded video. This flag is recommended when you use Likeer
to update your personal archive.

```bash
$ likeer -u @username -f
# => Example Username - 000003.mp4 [========================] 11.1 MB | 100%
# => Example Username - 000002.mp4; skipping
# => User @username in sync!
```
